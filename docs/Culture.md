# Culture

The culture of a team is extremely important.  It is the single biggest factor that makes people want to stay in their job or leave it.  

Here are some points about the culture we want, not in any particular order:

* We are all professionals and are all adults.  We are expected to know how to manage ourselves and our time.  
* We are obsessed with quality on every level.
* We work semi-async.  We manage our time as adults, but understand that we need to be available for communication and teamwork during working hours.  Being unavailable should be the exception, not the rule.  When we are going to be unavailable, we communicate to the team. 
* We take responsibility.  If we make a mistake, we own up to it and fix it.  We don't try to hide it. 
* We are obsessed with quality on every level. 
* Nobody knows everything.  At the same time, we all bring unique strengths to the team.  We learn new things from each other.  As time goes on, we gain skills from each other and the team becomes naturally more homogenous.  
* We are capable of working on our own but we vastly prefer working together.  Pair programming, war room coding, reviews, feedback... these should happen often and organically.  Ultimately everything we do is owned by the team.
