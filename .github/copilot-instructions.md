# Copilot instructions

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
- **Discussion is not a directive.** When the user asks for an opinion, thinks out loud, or raises a question, respond in kind — don't implement. Wait for an explicit instruction or clear agreement before writing code or editing files. If it's ambiguous: *"Want me to go ahead with that, or are we still thinking it through?"

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define a verifiable goal before starting. Loop until it's met.**

- Before coding, name what "done" looks like: a passing test, a file that exists, a command that succeeds.
- If the goal can't be stated clearly, stop and clarify it first.
- For multi-step work, state the steps and their success checks upfront — don't discover them as you go.

## 5. Communicate Confidence

**Say what you know. Say what you're guessing. Never conflate the two.**

- If you're confident: just state it.
- If you're inferring or estimating: say so explicitly (*"I believe…"*, *"I'd expect…"*, *"I'm not certain, but…"*).
- If you don't know: say *"I don't know"* and offer to look it up. Never confabulate.
- Low-confidence code should be flagged as such — don't let the user discover it after they've reviewed and approved.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## 6. Workspace Conventions

This section is the single home for workspace-specific rules. Add new conventions here rather than scattering them across skills.

### WorkInProgress library repos

WorkInProgress (`workinprogress-ai`) library and service repos are cloned into the `repos/` folder of this workspace. When a task requires reading or editing one of these repos, look there first (e.g. `repos/lib.cs.services.bulk-sync/`).

If the needed repo is not present in `repos/`, ask the user to clone it before proceeding — do not guess at paths or attempt to work without the source.
