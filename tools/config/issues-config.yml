# Issue Type Configuration
# Defines available issue types for issue-create.sh
# Uses GitHub's native issue type field (Bug, Feature, Task)
#
# To get issue type IDs:
# - CLI: gh api graphql -f query='query { organization(login: "YOUR_ORG") { issueTypes(first: 100) { edges { node { id name } } } } }' | jq .
# - GitHub UI: Go to Organization Settings → Planning → Issue types, and when you edit a type, the ID is in the URL
